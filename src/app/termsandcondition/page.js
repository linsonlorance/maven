                    We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Service
                    from time to time. We may do this for a variety of reasons
                    including to reflect changes in or requirements of the law,
                    new features, or changes in business practices. The most
                    recent version of this Agreement will be posted on the
                    Service under Settings and also on goMaven Match.com, and
                    you should regularly check for the most recent version. The
                    most recent version is the version that applies. If the
                    changes include material changes to your rights or
                    obligations, we will notify you in advance of the changes
                    (unless we’re unable to do so under applicable law) by
                    reasonable means, which could include notification through
                    the Service or via email. If you continue to use the Service

                  <p>
                    Maven Match is always striving to improve the Service and
                    bring you additional functionality that you will find
                    engaging and useful. This means we may add new product
                    features or enhancements from time to time as well as remove
                    some features, and if these actions do not materially affect
                    your rights or obligations, we may not provide you with
                    notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Service
                    entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance
                    unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security
                    concerns, prevent us from doing so.
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason,
                    by following the instructions in “Settings” in the Service.
                    However, if you use a third party payment account such as

                    caution in all interactions with other members, particularly
                    if you decide to communicate off the Service or meet in

                  <p>
                    By creating an account, you grant to Maven Match a
                    worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, right
                    and license to host, store, use, copy, display, reproduce,
                    adapt, edit, publish, modify, reformat, incorporate into
                    other works, advertise, distribute, and otherwise make
                    available to the general public information you authorize us
                    to access from third parties such as Facebook, Google, or
                    Apple, as well as any information you post, upload, display
                    or otherwise make available (collectively, “post”) on the
                    Service or transmit to other members (collectively,
                    “Content”). Maven Match’s license to your Content shall be
                    non-exclusive, except that Maven Match’s license shall be
                    exclusive with respect to derivative works created through
                    use of the Service. For example, Maven Match would have an
                    exclusive license to screenshots of the Service that include
                    your Content. In addition, so that Maven Match can prevent
                    the use of your Content outside of the Service, you
                    authorize Maven Match to act on your behalf with respect to
                    infringing uses of your Content taken from the Service by
                    other members or third parties. This expressly includes the
                    authority, but not the obligation, to send notices pursuant
                    to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA Takedown Notices) on
                    your behalf if your Content is taken and used by third
                    parties outside of the Service. Our license to your Content
                    is subject to your rights under applicable law (for example
                    laws regarding personal data protection to the extent any
                    Content contains personal information as defined by those
                    laws) and is for the limited purpose of operating,
                    developing, providing, and improving the Service and
                    researching and developing new ones. You agree that any
                    Content you place or that you authorize us to place on the
                    Service may be viewed by other members and may be viewed by

                    behaved in a way that Maven Match regards as inappropriate
                    or unlawful, including actions or communications that occur
                    on or off the Service. In addition, in certain instances, we
                    may terminate your account for violating the applicable

                  <p>
                    Generally. From time to time, Maven Match may offer products
                    and services for purchase (“in app purchases”) through the
                    App Store, Google Play Store, carrier billing, Maven Match
                    direct billing or other payment platforms authorized by
                    Maven Match. If you choose to make an in app purchase, you
                    will be prompted to confirm your purchase with the
                    applicable payment provider, and your method of payment (be
                    it your card or a third party account such as Google Play
                    Store or the App Store) (your “Payment Method”) will be
                    charged for the in app purchase at the prices displayed to
                    you for the service(s) you’ve selected as well as any sales
                    or similar taxes that may be imposed on your payments, and
                    you authorize Maven Match or the third party account, as
                    applicable, to charge you.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                    Auto-Renewal. If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic
                    subscription through an in app purchase, your Payment Method
                    will continue to be billed for the subscription until you
                    cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period,
                    and again after any subsequent subscription period, your
                    subscription will automatically continue for an additional
                    equivalent period, at the
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    price you agreed to when subscribing. Your card payment
                    information will be stored and subsequently used for the
                    automatic card payments in accordance with the Agreement.

                  <p>
                    If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically,
                    or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you
                    will need to log in to your third party account (or Settings
                    on Maven Match, if applicable) and follow the instructions
                    to terminate or cancel your subscription, even if you have
                    otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have
                    deleted the Maven Match application from your device.
                    Deleting your account on Maven Match or deleting the Maven
                    Match application from your device does not terminate or
                    cancel your subscription; Maven Match will retain all funds
                    charged to your Payment Method until you terminate or cancel
                    your subscription on Maven Match or the third party account,
                    as applicable. If you terminate or cancel your subscription,
                    you may use your subscription until the end of your
                    then-current subscription term, and your subscription will
                    not be renewed after your then-current term expires.

                    Additional Terms that apply if you pay Maven Match directly
                    with your Payment Method. If you pay Maven Match directly,
                    Maven Match may correct any billing errors or mistakes that
                    it makes even if it has already requested or received
                    payment. If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a
                    payment made with your Payment Method, Maven Match may
                    terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion.

                    You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting
                    Maven Match and going to Settings. If a payment is not
                    successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds,
                    or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method
                    information, terminate or cancel your subscription, you
                    remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize
                    us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be
                    updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing
                    dates. In addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or
                    replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your
                    credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit
                    card issuer. The terms of your payment will be based on your
                    Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between
                    you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or
                    other provider of your chosen Payment Method.

                    Virtual Items. From time to time, you may be able to
                    purchase, earn, or be granted a limited, personal,
                    non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to
                    use “virtual items,” which could include virtual products or
                    virtual “coins” or other units that are exchangeable within
                    the Service for virtual products (collectively, “Virtual
                    Items”). Any Virtual Item balance shown in your account does
                    not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored
                    value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent
                    of your license. Virtual Items do not incur fees for

                    Items will terminate in accordance with the terms of this
                    Agreement, when Maven Match ceases providing the Service, or
                    your account is otherwise closed or terminated. Maven Match,
                    in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees
                    for the right to access or use Virtual Items and may
                    distribute Virtual Items with or without charge. Maven Match
                    may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual
                    Items at any time. Maven Match shall have no liability to
                    you or any third party in the event that Maven Match
                    exercises any such rights. Virtual Items may only be

                    REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND IN RESPECT OF VIRTUAL ITEMS FOR
                    ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER
                    COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS

                    days of the transaction date, or if the laws applicable in

                    of your alleged damages (if any). You must
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    personally sign this Notice for it to be effective. Maven
                    Match’s Notice must likewise set forth a detailed
                    description of its Dispute, which shall include the nature
                    and factual basis of its claim(s) and the relief it is
                    seeking, with a corresponding calculation of our damages (if
                    any). You and Maven Match agree to then negotiate in good
                    faith in an effort to resolve the Dispute. As part of these
                    good faith negotiations, if Maven Match requests a telephone
                    conference with you to discuss your Dispute, you agree to
                    personally participate, with your attorney if you’re
                    represented by counsel. Likewise, if you request a telephone
                    conference to discuss Maven Match’s Dispute with you, Maven
                    Match agrees to have one representative participate. This
                    informal process should lead to a resolution of the Dispute.
                    However, if the Dispute is not resolved within 60 days after
                    receipt of a fully completed Notice and the Parties have not
                    otherwise mutually agreed to an extension of this informal
                    dispute resolution time period, you or Maven Match may
                    initiate an arbitration (subject to a Party’s right to elect
                    small claims court as provided below).
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    Completion of this informal dispute resolution is a
                    condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration or
                    small claims court action. Failure to do so is a breach of
                    this Agreement. The statute of limitations and any filing
                    fee deadlines will be tolled while you and Maven Match
                    engage in this informal dispute resolution process. Unless
                    prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider,
                    National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”), shall not accept
                    or administer any demand for arbitration and shall
                    administratively close any arbitration unless the Party
                    bringing such demand for arbitration can certify in writing
                    that the terms and conditions of this informal dispute
                    resolution process were fully satisfied. A court of
                    competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this
                    provision and to enjoin any arbitration proceeding or small
                    claims court action.

                    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, YOU AND Maven Match
                    EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THE RIGHT TO
                    LITIGATE DISPUTES IN COURT IN FAVOR OF INDIVIDUAL
                    ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PROVIDED
                    ABOVE). YOU AND Maven Match EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO FILE OR
                    PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER OR OTHERWISE
                    TO SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS, INCLUDING ANY CURRENTLY
                    PENDING ACTIONS AGAINST Maven Match. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
                    ALLOWABLE BY LAW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR
                    ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS,
                    COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, CONSOLIDATED, OR PRIVATE
                    ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS. THE ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THE SAME
                    RELIEF AVAILABLE IN COURT PROVIDED THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY
                    ONLY AWARD FINAL RELIEF (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE OR DECLARATORY
                    RELIEF) IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND
                    ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FINAL RELIEF
                    WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR

                    ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION ON A CLASS,

                    PROHIBITIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE UNENFORCEABLE AS TO A

                    DECISION ARE EXHAUSTED OR THE DECISION IS OTHERWISE FINAL,
                    THEN YOU AND Maven Match AGREE THAT THAT PARTICULAR CLAIM OR

                    Any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Maven
                    Match (that is not resolved informally by Maven Match
                    Customer Service or as provided under subsection 15a above)
                    that arises from or relates in any way to this Agreement
                    (including any alleged breach of this Agreement), the
                    Service, or our relationship with you (collectively,
                    “Dispute”), shall be exclusively resolved through BINDING
                    INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION except as specifically provided
                    otherwise in this Dispute Resolution Section. “Dispute” as
                    used in this Agreement shall have the broadest possible
                    meaning and include claims that arose before the existence
                    of this or any prior Agreement and claims that arise during
                    the term of this Agreement or after the termination of this
                    Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or
                    Maven Match may elect to have an individual claim heard in
                    small claims court. If the request to proceed in small
                    claims court is made after an arbitration has been initiated
                    but before an arbitrator has been appointed, such
                    arbitration shall be administratively closed. Any
                    controversy over the small claims court’s jurisdiction shall
                    be determined by the small claims court. All other issues
                    (except as otherwise provided herein) are exclusively for
                    the Arbitrator to decide, including but not limited to scope
                    and enforceability of this Dispute Resolution Section, as
                    well as any request to proceed in small claims court that is
                    made after an arbitrator has been appointed. If you or Maven
                    Match challenges the small claims court election in your
                    Dispute, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines
                    that the small claims court election is unenforceable, then
                    such election shall be severed from this Agreement as to
                    your Dispute. However, such court determination shall not be
                    considered or deemed binding with respect to Maven Match’s
                    other contracting parties.

                    Any court proceeding to enforce this Dispute Resolution
                    Section 15, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or
                    vacate an arbitration award, must be commenced in accordance

                    17. In the event Dispute Resolution Section 15 is for any
                    reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against
                    Maven Match (except for small claims court actions) may be
                    commenced only in the federal or state courts located in
                    Lake County, Illinois. You hereby irrevocably consent to
                    those courts’ exercise of personal jurisdiction over you for
                    such purposes and waive any claim that such courts
                    constitute an inconvenient forum.

                      to NAM after fully completing the informal Notice and
                      Dispute resolution process described in subsection 15a
                      above and when no small claims court election is made by
                      either Party. Any arbitration between you and Maven Match
                      shall be administered by NAM in accordance with NAM’s
                      operative Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and
                      Procedures (the “NAM Rules”) in effect at the time any

                    Commencing an Arbitration – To initiate an arbitration, you

                    (“Demand for Arbitration”) that describes the claim(s) and
                    request for relief in detail, consistent with the

                    within 10 days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration to

                    also send it to your mailing address on file with us within
                    the same 10-day period. If your mailing address is

                    Maven Match is committed to ensuring that arbitration costs
                    to consumers do not serve as a barrier to the adjudication
                    of disputes. If Maven Match initiates an arbitration against
                    you, we shall pay all fees.

                    The Arbitrator – The arbitration shall be conducted by a
                    single, neutral arbitrator (the “Claim Arbitrator”), as
                    assisted by any Process Arbitrator appointed under NAM
                    Rules. (The term “Arbitrator” applies to both the Claim
                    Arbitrator and the Process Arbitrator). If a hearing is
                    elected by either Party, the Arbitrator shall be in or close
                    to the location in which you reside. The Arbitrator is bound
                    by and shall adhere to this Agreement. In the event NAM
                    Rules conflict with this Agreement, the terms of this
                    Agreement shall control. If the Arbitrator determines that
                    strict application of any term of Section 15 of this
                    Agreement (except for the small claims election, which shall
                    be determined by the small claims court) would result in a
                    fundamentally unfair arbitration (the “Unfair Term”), then
                    the Arbitrator shall have authority to modify the Unfair
                    Term to the extent necessary to ensure a fundamentally fair
                    arbitration that is consistent with the Agreement (the
                    “Modified Term”). In determining the substance of a Modified
                    Term, the Arbitrator shall select a term that comes closest
                    to expressing the intention of the Unfair Term.

                  <p>
                    Dispositive Motions – The Parties agree that the Claim
                    Arbitrator shall have the authority to consider dispositive
                    motions without an oral evidentiary hearing. Dispositive
                    motions may be requested under the following circumstances:
                    (a) within 30 days after the Claim Arbitrator’s appointment,
                    a Party may request to file a dispositive motion based upon
                    the pleadings; and (b) no later than 30 days prior to the
                    evidentiary hearing, a Party may request to file a
                    dispositive motion for summary judgment based upon the
                    Parties’ pleadings and the evidence submitted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <br />
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Discovery – Each Party may (a) serve up to five requests for
                    relevant, non-privileged documents from the other Party; and
                    (b) request that the other Party provide verified responses
                    to no more than 5 relevant interrogatories (including
                    subparts). Unless both Parties agree otherwise, no other
                    forms of discovery (including depositions) may be utilized.
                    Any such discovery requests must be served on the other
                    Party within 21 days after the Claim Arbitrator’s
                    appointment. The responding Party shall provide the
                    requesting Party with all responsive, non-privileged
                    documents, responses signed by the Party themselves to the
                    requested interrogatories, and/or any objections to the
                    requests within 30 days after receipt of the requests, or,
                    in the event of an objection to any discovery request, 30
                    days after the Claim Arbitrator resolves the dispute. In the
                    event either Party requests that the Claim Arbitrator
                    consider a dispositive motion on the pleadings, such written
                    discovery response deadlines shall be extended until 30 days
                    following the Claim Arbitrator’s final decision on such
                    dispositive motion. Any disputes about discovery or requests
                    for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the Claim
                    Arbitrator for resolution. In ruling on any discovery
                    dispute or extension request, the Claim Arbitrator shall
                    take into consideration the nature, amount, and scope of the
                    underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort that
                    would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the
                    case schedule, and
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    whether the requested discovery is necessary for the
                    adequate preparation of a claim or defense.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                    Confidentiality – Upon either Party’s request, the
                    Arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential
                    information of either Party disclosed during the arbitration
                    (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or
                    disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a
                    proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any
                    permitted court filing of confidential information must be
                    done under seal.

                  <p>
                    Arbitration Hearing – You and Maven Match are entitled to a
                    fair evidentiary hearing (i.e. trial) before the Claim
                    Arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings are usually simpler,
                    less costly, and more streamlined than trials and other
                    judicial proceedings. The Parties agree to waive all oral
                    hearings and instead submit all disputes to the Claim
                    Arbitrator for an award based on written submissions and
                    other evidence as the Parties may agree, unless a Party
                    requests an oral hearing within 10 days after the Respondent
                    files a response. If an oral evidentiary hearing is
                    requested, both Parties must be personally present at the
                    hearing, regardless of whether either Party has retained
                    counsel. Both Parties must personally attend the hearing.
                    Either Party’s failure to personally attend the hearing,
                    without a continuance ordered by the Claim Arbitrator for
                    good cause, will result in a default judgment taken against
                    that Party.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                    Arbitration Award – Regardless of the format of the
                    arbitration, the Claim Arbitrator shall provide a reasoned
                    decision, in writing within 30 days after the hearing or, if
                    no hearing is held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or
                    supplemental statements are due. The decision must clearly
                    specify the relief, if any, awarded and contain a brief
                    statement of the reasons for the award. The arbitration
                    award is binding only between you and Maven Match and will
                    not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or
                    proceeding that involves a different Party. The Claim
                    Arbitrator may, however, choose to consider rulings from
                    other arbitrations involving a different Party. The
                    Arbitrator may award fees and costs as provided by the NAM
                    Rules or to the extent such fees and costs could be awarded
                    in court. This includes but is not limited to the ability of
                    the Arbitrator to award fees and costs if the Arbitrator
                    determines that a claim or defense is frivolous or was
                    brought for an improper purpose, for the purpose of
                    harassment, or in bad faith.

                  <p>
                    Offer of Settlement – The Respondent may, but is not
                    obligated to, make a written settlement offer to the
                    opposing Party any time before the evidentiary hearing or,
                    if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the
                    dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any
                    settlement offer may not be disclosed to the Claim
                    Arbitrator until after the Claim Arbitrator issues an award
                    on the claim. If the award is issued in the opposing Party’s
                    favor and is less than the Respondent’s settlement offer or
                    if the award is in the Respondent’s favor, the opposing
                    Party must pay the Respondent’s costs incurred after the
                    offer was made, including any attorney’s fees. If any
                    applicable statute or caselaw prohibits the flipping of
                    costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this
                    provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs
                    that claimant may be entitled to for the cause of action
                    under which it is suing.

                        Bellwether Proceedings. Bellwether proceedings are
                        encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators when
                        there are multiple disputes involving similar claims
                        against the same or related parties. Counsel for the
                        Mass Filings claimants (including you) and counsel for
                        Maven Match shall each select 15 Demands for Arbitration
                        (30 total), and no more than 30 arbitrations shall be
                        filed, processed, adjudicated, or pending at the same
                        time, with each of the 30 individual arbitrations
                        presided over by a different Claim Arbitrator, in a
                        first set of bellwether proceedings. During this time,
                        no other Demands for arbitration that are part of the
                        Mass Filings may be filed, processed, adjudicated, or
                        pending. If the Parties are unable to resolve the
                        remaining Demands for Arbitration after the first set of
                        bellwether proceedings are arbitrated or otherwise
                        resolved, then counsel for the Claimants and counsel for
                        Maven Match shall each select an additional 15 Demands
                        for Arbitration (30) total to be filed, processed, and
                        adjudicated as individual arbitrations, with each of the
                        30 arbitrations presided over by a different Claim
                        Arbitrator, in a second set of bellwether proceedings.
                        During this time, no other Demands for Arbitration that
                        are part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, or
                        adjudicated. This staged process of bellwether
                        proceedings, with each set including 30 Demands for
                        Arbitration adjudicated on an individual basis, shall

                        (including your Demand for Arbitration) is adjudicated
                        or otherwise resolved. Fees associated with a Demand for

                        owed by Maven Match and the claimants (including you),

                        chosen as part of a set of bellwether proceedings and
                        therefore properly designated for filing, processing,
                        and adjudication. Any applicable statute of limitations
                        shall be tolled beginning when you initiate the informal
                        dispute resolution process set forth in subsection 15a
                        of the Agreement, and if the first Mass Filings’ Demands
                        for Arbitration are chosen for the initial set of
                        bellwether proceedings have been filed, your claims will
